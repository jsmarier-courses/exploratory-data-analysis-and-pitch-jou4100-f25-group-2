## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Pitch

For our EDA, we used the 2021 Long Form Census – Ward Data from the City of Ottawa, related to an overall question of "`Could official language laws in each ward affect the French population?`". The long-form dataset was a questionnaire of 25% of households and the short-form dataset was sent to 100% of households. Both these datasets were quantitative, whereas one was census data and survey response data. Our key observations were that the areas that had a predominant French-speaking population were majority in the east end of the City of Ottawa, whereas the English-speaking population was majority in the west-end and center.
